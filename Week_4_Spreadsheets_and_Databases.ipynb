    "*Question 1: What is the difference between a spreadsheet and a database?*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Answer: \n",
    "> A spreadsheet (like Excel) is built for organizing and analyzing data in rows and columns, usually on a smaller scale and often by one person at a time. It’s flexible, visual, and calculation-focused. A database is built to store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of structured data efficiently. It’s designed for multiple users, relationships between tables, data integrity, and long-term scalability. Spreadsheets analyze. Databases manage."
