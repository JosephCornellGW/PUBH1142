    "\n",
    "> Answer: An example of the misuse of health data is the case of Henrietta Lacks. In 1951, cancer cells were taken from Lacks during treatment for cervical cancer without her knowledge or consent, and these cells later known as HeLa cells were widely used in medical research and contributed to major scientific advances. Neither Lacks nor her family were informed at the time, and her identity was later publicly disclosed, raising concerns about privacy and exploitation. The ethical issues in this case include the lack of informed consent and respect for patient autonomy, particularly involving a vulnerable patient population. This situation could have been prevented through clear consent processes, transparency, and ethical oversight, which are now central principles in modern health data and research ethics."

    "\n",
    "> Answer: An example of a breach in health data security that I was affected by is the 2011 Tricare data breach involving the United States military health insurance provider. In this incident, backup tapes containing personal and health information of approximately five million patients were stolen from a vehicle during transport between facilities. Although it was unclear whether the data could be accessed or decrypted, the loss of the tapes was still considered a breach because sensitive health information was taken without authorization. The ethical concerns center on data protection and responsibility in handling patient information. This breach could have been prevented through stronger safeguards, including minimizing physical transport of data, ensuring secure storage during transit, and implementing stricter data handling and oversight procedures."

    "*Task: Find another example of bias in health data. Describe the event and the consequences. What could have been done to prevent this from happening?*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Answer: A well known example of bias in health data is the historical underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. For many years, medical research studies primarily enrolled male participants, and the resulting data were used to guide diagnosis, dosing, and treatment for the general population. This imbalance led to gaps in understanding how diseases and medications affect women differently, sometimes resulting in ineffective treatment or increased risk of adverse effects. The consequences of this bias include delayed recognition of gender specific symptoms and inappropriate medication dosing. This issue could have been prevented through inclusive study design, balanced participant recruitment, and earlier requirements for sex based analysis in clinical research."

    "*Task: Find an example of anonymization of health data. Describe the technique used.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Answer: An example of anonymization of health data is the use of de identified patient records in public health datasets released under HIPAA guidelines. In these datasets, direct identifiers such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and medical record numbers are removed before the data are shared for research or analysis. This technique, often referred to as data masking and generalization, allows researchers to study trends and outcomes without being able to trace the information back to specific individuals. By removing or generalizing identifying details, patient privacy is protected while still preserving the overall usefulness of the data for population level analysis."

    "\n",
    ">Answer: An example of a pro forma consent document for health data collection is the standard informed consent form used in clinical research studies approved by an institutional review board. These documents typically explain the purpose of the study, what data will be collected, how the data will be used and stored, who will have access to it, and the potential risks and benefits of participation. They also clearly state that participation is voluntary and that individuals may withdraw their consent at any time without penalty. This type of standardized consent document helps ensure transparency, protects participant autonomy, and establishes ethical accountability in health data collection."
