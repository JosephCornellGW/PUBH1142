# PUBH 1142 – Introduction to Health Data Science

This repository documents coursework and applied exercises from **PUBH 1142: Introduction to Health Data Science** at The George Washington University.

I am a Health Data Science student with a professional background in healthcare and emergency medical services. My interests include public health analytics, ethical data use, and translating complex health data into actionable insight.

The notebooks in this repository reflect hands-on learning with Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and foundational health analytics concepts, and will continue to evolve as my skills and coursework progress.
